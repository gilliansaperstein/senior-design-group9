        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <div id="need-statement">
            <h2>Need Statement</h2>
            <p>Researchers working to minimize developmental issues in premature babies caused by stress, resulting from an isolated, noisy environment, are in need of a small, lightweight device to be used in a study that measures limb movements indicative of stress to determine if listening to recordings of a mother’s voice reduces stress and improves the medical outcomes of the child.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="project-scope">
            <h2>Project Scope</h2>
            <p>Our client requested a device that will measure the movements of incubated premature infants. This device will be used in a study that attempts to reduce stress levels by playing recordings of the infant’s mother’s voice. When the infants feel stress, they move more and burn calories, which is dangerous for premature infants of that size. The physiological impact of stress can also lead to developmental issues as the baby grows. Existing solutions are too large to be worn by a premature infant or not accurate enough for a scientific study. The device must be safe for a premature baby without hindering its movements, while being sensitive enough to accurately detect those movements. In April, we will be delivering a device prototype with accompanying software, circuit diagrams, and mechanical drawings to Dr. Bozzette.</p>
