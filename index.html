        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <div id="need-statement">
            <h2>Need Statement</h2>
            <p>Researchers working to minimize developmental issues in premature babies caused by stress, resulting from an isolated, noisy environment, are in need of a small, lightweight device to be used in a study that measures limb movements indicative of stress to determine if listening to recordings of a mother’s voice reduces stress and improves the medical outcomes of the child.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="project-scope">
            <h2>Project Scope</h2>
            <p>Our client requested a device that will measure the movements of incubated premature infants. This device will be used in a study that attempts to reduce stress levels by playing recordings of the infant’s mother’s voice. When the infants feel stress, they move more and burn calories, which is dangerous for premature infants of that size. The physiological impact of stress can also lead to developmental issues as the baby grows. Existing solutions are too large to be worn by a premature infant or not accurate enough for a scientific study. The device must be safe for a premature baby without hindering its movements, while being sensitive enough to accurately detect those movements. In April, we will be delivering a device prototype with accompanying software, circuit diagrams, and mechanical drawings to Dr. Bozzette.</p>

In addition, we improved our understanding of how the accelerometer works, so we can continue to refine the hardware design. This week, our software work mainly focused on counting and defining movements instead of the user interface. We also determined that a calibration period will be necessary to obtain a baseline value of the accelerometer at rest, which will then be subtracted from the output when the accelerometer is in motion, so we implemented this code as well.</td>

            This week, we met on Sunday to try to work the power source and battery into the circuit, replacing the need for the laptop to be connected. While we were able to get the power source/battery to work, we were not yet able to integrate it with the circuit, as we still need the laptop to run code to the Arduino.
            
            We then met on Wednesday to discuss how we plan to go about completing the V&V report. Carley began doing FDA research, Julia worked on CAD and researched ways to make the circuit wireless, while Gillian worked on building the user interface. We also started working with conductive thread, fabric, and foam to try building the physical bracelet.
            
            Moving forward, we're planning to use next week to finalize our pre-V&V prototype and complete the V&V report.
            
            The plan for this prototype is to have just the accelerometer on the baby's wrist, and connect with with very long wires to the rest of the circuit which will be on a breadboard that sits beside the baby.

          <td>This week, we made progress on our prototype. We lengthened the wires connecting the accelerometer to the rest of the hardware and made a wristband for the accelerometer so that the amount of circuitry connected to the baby is minimized, thus reducing the weight. We also 3D printed a case for the accelerometer to protect the circuitry from fluids. In addition to the progress on the hardware end, we further developed the software needed to calibrate the device and count movements. Lastly, we worked on our Verification and Validation plan and report.</td>

          <td>This week, we focused on planning ahead for the rest of the semester. Our biggest priority is developing the software needed for the device to function, so Gillian will take the prototype with her over spring break to work on it. We also brainstormed ways to improve our device; we decided to reprint the case housing the accelerometer to make it smaller, more lightweight, and circular. We will also attempt to make the device wireless using the transmitter. Lastly, Julia presented our V&V report to the class this week as well.</td>

          <td>This week, we continued to refine our prototype. We designed and 3D printed a new circular case that was smaller and had rounded edges, and we determined that we needed to make the diameter 1 mm bigger and increase the height of the case to make the prototype fit. These updates have been made and the updated plans have been sent for printing. We also worked on the software, and tried to figure out the best way to stream the data to make the important information most accessible to the nurses. This is something we will continue to work on next week, but we discussed different programming languages and importing the raw data into a csv file. Lastly, we discussed some design competitions to enter our prototype in, like the DEBUT competition.</td>

          <td>While we had to cancel one of our meetings due to multiple team members being sick, we were still able to meet later on in the week. On Monday, a new print of the case was picked up. It's height and diameter seemed to fit the accelerometer, however, the hole for the wires was placed incorrectly and the bottom was broken/contained gaps (possibly due to trying to make the edge more rounded). We made improvements to our design and sent the next (and hopefully final) version of our case to be printed. We also worked on the software component of the device. Our current approach is to use the Pythagorean theorem to get a singular, timestamped value that represents the acceleration measured in each of the three directions. We will then use that to count movements. We also discussed other approaches, such as calculating the velocity based on time and acceleration values, or creating a "score" based off of the average value of acceleration recorded that can be used to compare between the control and experimental group.</td>

          <td>This week, we met several times to continue working on the prototype. We upgraded the wristband design by using two strips of velcro stuck back-to-back, which made the connection to the case more secure and the size more adjustable. We also finalized our case for the accelerometer to make it as small as possible while still fitting the hardware. Lastly, we continued developing the software. We are able to get raw data and are trying to determine the best way to count movements. We tried using the acceleration values to calculate velocity in addition to trying to determine movements from the acceleration values. To interface with the nurses best, we are looking into an interactive website that would be able to capture and analyze data while giving instructions to the nurses.</td>

          <td>This week, we are finishing the final touches on our prototype and we are continuing to do our verification. We met with one of the web development professors on Thursday to see whether we could create a live website for our device. Additionally, we bought a replacement microcontroller because we have been borrowing one for all of our research up until now. It has a bluetooth component, which we will try to integrate into our design if time permits, but otherwise the prototype is complete. We will be meeting this weekend to finish up final testing and start writing the final report.</td>
