        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <div id="need-statement">
            <h2>Need Statement</h2>
            <p>Researchers working to minimize developmental issues in premature babies caused by stress, resulting from an isolated, noisy environment, are in need of a small, lightweight device to be used in a study that measures limb movements indicative of stress to determine if listening to recordings of a mother’s voice reduces stress and improves the medical outcomes of the child.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="project-scope">
            <h2>Project Scope</h2>
            <p>Our client requested a device that will measure the movements of incubated premature infants. This device will be used in a study that attempts to reduce stress levels by playing recordings of the infant’s mother’s voice. When the infants feel stress, they move more and burn calories, which is dangerous for premature infants of that size. The physiological impact of stress can also lead to developmental issues as the baby grows. Existing solutions are too large to be worn by a premature infant or not accurate enough for a scientific study. The device must be safe for a premature baby without hindering its movements, while being sensitive enough to accurately detect those movements. In April, we will be delivering a device prototype with accompanying software, circuit diagrams, and mechanical drawings to Dr. Bozzette.</p>

In addition, we improved our understanding of how the accelerometer works, so we can continue to refine the hardware design. This week, our software work mainly focused on counting and defining movements instead of the user interface. We also determined that a calibration period will be necessary to obtain a baseline value of the accelerometer at rest, which will then be subtracted from the output when the accelerometer is in motion, so we implemented this code as well.</td>

            This week, we met on Sunday to try to work the power source and battery into the circuit, replacing the need for the laptop to be connected. While we were able to get the power source/battery to work, we were not yet able to integrate it with the circuit, as we still need the laptop to run code to the Arduino.
            
            We then met on Wednesday to discuss how we plan to go about completing the V&V report. Carley began doing FDA research, Julia worked on CAD and researched ways to make the circuit wireless, while Gillian worked on building the user interface. We also started working with conductive thread, fabric, and foam to try building the physical bracelet.
            
            Moving forward, we're planning to use next week to finalize our pre-V&V prototype and complete the V&V report.
            
            The plan for this prototype is to have just the accelerometer on the baby's wrist, and connect with with very long wires to the rest of the circuit which will be on a breadboard that sits beside the baby.

          <td>This week, we made progress on our prototype. We lengthened the wires connecting the accelerometer to the rest of the hardware and made a wristband for the accelerometer so that the amount of circuitry connected to the baby is minimized, thus reducing the weight. We also 3D printed a case for the accelerometer to protect the circuitry from fluids. In addition to the progress on the hardware end, we further developed the software needed to calibrate the device and count movements. Lastly, we worked on our Verification and Validation plan and report.</td>

          <td>This week, we focused on planning ahead for the rest of the semester. Our biggest priority is developing the software needed for the device to function, so Gillian will take the prototype with her over spring break to work on it. We also brainstormed ways to improve our device; we decided to reprint the case housing the accelerometer to make it smaller, more lightweight, and circular. We will also attempt to make the device wireless using the transmitter. Lastly, Julia presented our V&V report to the class this week as well.</td>
